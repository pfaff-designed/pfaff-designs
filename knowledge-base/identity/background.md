Knowledge Base: Identity

Professional Identity

I am a Design Engineer and Applied AI technologist who works at the intersection of product design, front-end engineering, and emerging technology. My background spans UX, interaction design, and component systems, and I specialize in building experiences where thoughtful design and strong engineering reinforce each other.

My work focuses on creating intentional, human-centered digital products using tools like React, TypeScript, modern UI frameworks, and AI-assisted systems. I am most energized when I am solving ambiguous problems, shaping the structure of a product, or building the design systems, patterns, and components that bring an experience to life.

I have contributed to complex platforms across travel, retail, e-commerce, and financial services, and I have worked as both a designer and a front-end engineer. Because I am fluent in both disciplines, I can translate ideas into working systems quickly and collaborate deeply with cross-functional teams.

Recently, my work has expanded into applied AI engineering, where I build systems that blend structured design principles with AI-driven content and layout generation. I enjoy exploring how AI can support clarity, efficiency, and creativity in digital experiences while still maintaining high standards of quality, intention, and craft.

I am currently looking for opportunities that allow me to continue bridging design and engineering while strengthening my AI engineering abilities. I am especially interested in roles such as Design Engineer, AI Front-End Engineer, Creative Technologist, and Design Systems Engineer.

Skills

Front-End Engineering

I build reliable, scalable interfaces using modern front-end tools and frameworks. My focus is on component-driven architecture, strong type safety, and accessible, responsive layouts.

Core skills include:
	•	React and modern React patterns
	•	TypeScript with strict typing
	•	Next.js and server/client component architecture
	•	Tailwind CSS and utility-driven styling
	•	UI frameworks such as shadcn/ui
	•	State modeling and predictable component flows
	•	Rendering logic for dynamic and data-driven interfaces
	•	Testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Storybook visual testing

Design Engineering

I work across design and development, creating systems that are visually consistent, performance-minded, and easy for teams to use.

Strengths include:
	•	Design systems thinking
	•	Component architecture and Atomic Design
	•	Interaction design and usability
	•	Modular layout and hierarchy
	•	Visual hierarchy and typographic systems
	•	Design-to-code translation
	•	Figma proficiency, including libraries, components, and layout tools
	•	Systems for responsive and adaptive design

Applied AI Engineering

I enjoy building AI-assisted experiences that integrate structured content, controlled generation, validation, and interactive UI.

Capabilities include:
	•	Multi-agent systems (orchestrator, copywriter, retrieval agents)
	•	Prompt engineering and structured-output prompting
	•	Retrieval-augmented generation
	•	Semantic search with embeddings
	•	Deterministic, validated JSON outputs
	•	Using models like Anthropic Sonnet and Haiku
	•	Designing AI systems that respect constraints and design rules

Backend & System Integration

While primarily a front-end and design engineer, I am comfortable working across the stack when needed.

Experience includes:
	•	Supabase (database, auth, storage, edge functions)
	•	REST APIs and serverless functions
	•	Real-time database syncing
	•	Deployment and hosting on Vercel
	•	Data modeling for structured and semantic content

Tools & Process

Tools I use regularly include:
	•	Git, GitHub, and feature-branch workflows
	•	Cursor for AI-assisted development
	•	Storybook for component documentation
	•	Figma for design and prototyping
	•	VS Code and modern development tooling
	•	Node.js and package management

Soft Skills & Collaboration

I work well in cross-functional environments and thrive in roles where communication and clarity matter.

Strengths include:
	•	Communicating ideas clearly and adapting explanations across disciplines
	•	Helping teammates grow through knowledge sharing and thoughtful feedback
	•	Translating between design and engineering mindsets
	•	Strong user empathy
	•	Bringing structure to ambiguous problems
	•	Staying positive and grounded in collaborative settings

Values

Curiosity

I enjoy understanding how things work and exploring new ideas. Curiosity drives my learning and helps me uncover grounded solutions.

Creativity

My creativity comes from making things and putting them into the world. I balance structure with exploration and enjoy shaping ideas into real experiences.

Positivity

I try to approach collaboration with positivity and a steady mindset. I focus on keeping communication open and helping teams work smoothly.

Intention

I care about thoughtful decision-making, from layout choices to interaction patterns. Small details contribute to experiences that feel considered.

Craft

I value the craft behind good interfaces: typography, spacing, rhythm, and interaction. I focus on the details that create cohesive, enjoyable experiences.

Empathy

I think about the user as a guest in an experience. I want what I build to feel welcoming, clear, and supportive.

Resourcefulness

My DIY background taught me to figure things out with whatever tools I have. I stay adaptable, curious, and willing to learn quickly.

Education

I have a B.S. in Marketing with a concentration in Brand Management and Product Development, where I learned how to identify business needs and think with stakeholders in mind. I also hold an MBA from VCU’s Brandcenter in Experience Design, which taught me to think empathetically about end users, understand their needs, and use creativity to design meaningful solutions.

Personal Philosophy & Working Style

My early years in a DIY band shaped how I think about building digital products. Back then, I created things I cared about and wanted to share them with people. Everything I did — booking shows, making artwork, designing websites — served that goal. That mindset carries through my work today.

Design and engineering are now the tools I use to close the gap between what I can make and what people need. I think about the end user like a guest in my house and aim to create experiences that feel welcoming, intuitive, and intentional.

My process begins with understanding the problem and the person behind it. I explore, prototype, validate, and then refine until the interaction feels grounded and thoughtful. I enjoy the balance between creativity and structure and move fluidly between design thinking and engineering execution.

I stay curious, communicate openly, and approach collaboration with encouragement and clarity. I care about outcomes that feel meaningful and well-crafted, and I try to build things that help people in a way that feels honest and human.
